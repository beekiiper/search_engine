he next lesson was French. I like French. It’s nice to be able to talk to somebody in another language.
      At last, it was eleven o’clock: time for break. Nell gave me a piece of cake to eat with my milk. She also gave me her Latin homework to copy. I think she likes me and she’s a nice girl.
After break, we had two lessons of  Latin! They are bad: I hate Latin!
 Mr Williams punished me for talking to Nell.
